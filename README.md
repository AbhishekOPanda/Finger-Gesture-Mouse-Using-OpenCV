# Finger-Gesture-Mouse-Using-OpenCV
This project was completed in over a span of 3 months time by four of us. After doing a bit of research on OpenCV, we got to the idea of making this. As a team over viewer, I took care of combining all the work and submitting it, and also was the major developer of the project. 
The primary goal of this study's finger gesture mouse is to improve and simplify human work through human-computer interaction. This will cut down on processing time and increase user comfort while using the system. Python's OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, and NumPy packages make it possible. In order to conduct the functions in accordance with the color finger gesture, we designed a PC application. An alternative to a real mouse is this. This can be used anywhere it would be awkward or difficult to grasp a real mouse.
